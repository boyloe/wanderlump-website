            After Utah, we headed north in search of cooler days and nights and
            we found an amazing spot to call home in western Colorado. We spent
            almost a week in Mack and enjoyed the isolation and amazing sunsets.

            After sunset, every insect within a 10-mile radius was attracted to
            the lights in our trailer, which both cats thoroughly enjoyed. They
            are ferocious hunters! Lumpy and Catalina both sat in front of the
            large window trying to catch bugs on the other side. I&apos;m not
            sure what types of moths are in Mack, CO, but they were not like any
            moth I&apos;d ever seen before – large, bright green mutants. They
            would walk across the glass teasing Lumpy as she tried with all her
            might to catch them with her little pee-paws. The joke was on the
            swarm of insects taunting poor, sweet Lumpy. We saw something huge
            fly by the window that was five times the size of the moths and
            quickly realized they were bats. Every few minutes we would see one
            dive bomb through the smorgasbord of bugs our lights had created.
            The bats were like, “Thanks for the snacks, stupid.” They must have

            Black Canyon of Gunnison National Park wasn&apos;t too far away, so
            we made our way there, hoping one of the few spots that could
            accommodate a travel trailer were free. With boondocking, nothing is
            guaranteed, so you should always have a plan A, B, and C!
            Unfortunately, there weren&apos;t any available spots, so we headed
            back to plan B in Montrose, CO. Again, we were pretty much alone,
            other than a handful of ATVers. It was windy and it was a parking
            lot, but it was exactly what we needed – a place to stay that was
            safe and had good cell signal. Since it was still hot, we
            didn&apos;t want to use the oven or stove top and make it even
            hotter inside, so Bryan got to work doing what he loves – grilling!
            One of our favorite meals that is quick, makes almost no mess, and
            is so fresh and delicious is chicken with sliced tomatoes, fresh
            mozzarella, basil, and a generous drizzle of olive oil and balsamic
            vinegar. When we don&apos;t feel like meal planning, that is our go
            to!

            Our first night there we watched another amazing sunset while
            feasting on grilled chicken and washing it down with some Cabernet.
            Lumpy even convinced us to let her come outside and watch the
            sunset. And then she launched herself off the chair and immediately
            lost those privileges.

            After work the next day, we took a trip into the South Rim of Black
            Canyon of Gunnison National Park. It was too hot to leave the cats
            and most of the trails along Black Canyon Scenic Drive are short
            hikes to an overlook, so they came to the park with us. I would like
            to take a minute to describe just how weird Catalina can be. She
            loves her carrier and one of her usual positions is head cocked
            straight up. It in no way seems comfortable, but she loves laying
            like that.

            We are very lucky that they get along 99% of the time and they are

            On the way into the park, Lumpy was perched up on her seat and
            Catalina had the nerve to walk on her and then lay down with her
            butt right in Lumpy&apos;s face.

            This park is absolutely beautiful! The South Rim has a 14-mile
            scenic drive with multiple short trails with lookout points viewing
            different parts of the canyon, so the cats slept in the
            air-conditioned truck while we took in the beauty of the steep
            cliffs that the Gunnison River carved out over two million years. As
            we looked down at the river thousands of feet below, we could
            actually hear the water raging through the canyon…until we

            Love is in the air…and bushes…and trees
          </h2>
          <p className="my-8 font-lato text-xl tracking-wide text-justify">
            All the bushes and trees we walked by had snapping, clicking noises
            coming out of them and the eerie sound echoed throughout the canyon.
            We had stumbled upon cicada season and they were everywhere. The
            cicadas that live in Colorado usually have a much shorter life cycle
            (2-5 years) compared to the cicadas in the Northeast (13-17 years),
            so they don&apos;t have quite as dramatic of an eruption, where
            billions to trillions of cicadas come out of the ground with one
            purpose – to mate. Apparently the annual cicadas are not as loud as
            the cicadas who have been waiting 17 years to procreate! The males
            clap their wings against their abdomens or the branch they are on
            and if a female likes his love song, she will return his song with
            her wings. Not wanting to interrupt this giant orgy, we took one
            last look at the Gunnison River below and made our way back to a
            much quieter truck, where Lumpy and Catalina were fast asleep.
