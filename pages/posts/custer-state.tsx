          Black Hills, SD is a must see! We spent the week in Custer State Park
          and did a combination of hikes off the beaten path, as well as popular
          tourist sites, like Mount Rushmore.

          Blue Bell Campground in Custer State Park
        </h2>
        <p className="my-4 font-lato text-xl tracking-wide text-justify">
          Normally Custer State Park doesn&apos;t open until May, but they
          opened Blue Bell Campground a week early, so we lucked out. This
          campground has electric hook ups and there was potable water in the
          campground and a very well maintained restroom. Each site has a fire
          ring, which we used every night. S&apos;mores taste incredible after a
          full day of working and hiking. The campground store opened the day
          before we left, just in time so we could purchase souvenirs.

          Wildlife Loop Road in Custer State Park
        </h2>
        <p className="my-4 font-lato text-xl tracking-wide text-justify">
          On our first morning in Custer, we woke up early to drive along the
          scenic 18 mile Wildlife Loop Road. The road was blocked off and we
          quickly learned why – the horses used for trail riding in Blue Bell
          were being moved into the stables from another area. Seeing a stampede
          of horses was not a bad start to the wildlife loop. Further down the
          loop we were rewarded with a surprise – bison calves. The female bison
          had calved recently, so there were calves safely tucked next to their
          mother’s side all along the loop. We also saw bighorn sheep, mule
          deer, white-tailed deer, and pronghorns.

        <p className="my-4 font-lato text-xl tracking-wide text-justify">
          Sylvan Lake is one of the coolest places we have ever hiked. When we
          were there half of it was melted and the other half was covered in
          snow and ice. It is only 1.1 miles around, but it felt like we
          traveled through multiple different worlds on this short loop. We were
          treated to a dam, huge rocks you could climb, a partially frozen lake,
          and the remains of a snowman. You might recognize it from the movie
          <span className="italic"> National Treasure: Book of Secrets.</span>

          Black Elk Peak in Custer State Park
        </h2>
        <p className="my-4 font-lato text-xl tracking-wide text-justify">
          This hike was as breathtaking as Sylvan Lake, but much longer and much
          more challenging. At over 7,200 ft in elevation, Black Elk Peak is the
          highest natural point in South Dakota and is the highest peak east of
          the Rockies. The trail is a 7.1 mile loop and has 1,469 feet of
          elevation gain. We only saw a few other people hiking on segments of
          the trail, but none anywhere near the summit. The parts of the trail
          in the shadows of the mountains were still covered in snow and ice and
          we needed our YakTrax to safely traverse those parts of the trail.
          Near the top of the trail we startled a deer who cautiously eyed us up
          and then went running into the safety of the trees. We were proud of
          ourselves for reaching the trail summit, which has an old stone fire
          lookout tower and offers 360 degree views.

          At the bottom of the trail we learned about the mountain pine beetle
          infestation. Many trees have been removed to stop the beetle life
          cycle and many trees have died. We later learned that Custer State
          Park is very strict about not bringing firewood into the park from
          other states in an effort to prevent any other invasive species
          entering the park.

          We visited Mount Rushmore right as the sun was setting, so we could
          see it in the sunlight and lit up at night. The cell service is great,
          so we FaceTimed with my parents to share this experience with them.
          Maybe one day they will figure out the camera.

          Yes! We&apos;ve got to work to pay those bills and student debt! We
          use <a href="https://www.campendium.com">Campendium</a> to help us
          find sites with good cell signal, since we use our phones as a hot
          spot. Blue Bell Campground had a good signal, but there were some
          sites in the park with an even better signal and an incredible view.
          Custer State Park also has sheep with cell boosters on their necks to
          help increase the signal all over the park...
