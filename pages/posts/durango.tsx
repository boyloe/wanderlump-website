            Spring Bar Down
          </h2>
          <p className="my-4 font-lato text-xl tracking-wide text-justify">
            Not only did we survive boondocking by Blanca Peak, we thrived, so
            we decided to stay even longer off the grid in our own private spot
            in San Juan National Forest just outside of Durango, Colorado. Why
            go to Durango you might ask? To hike? To raft? To explore historic
            downtown Durango? Nope. We needed a FedEx!
          </p>
          <p className="my-4 font-lato text-xl tracking-wide text-justify">
            Let me go back a few days to when we were driving down I-25 South to
            the Great Sand Dunes. An incredibly unfortunate thing happened. We
            lost a spring bar! For those of you who don’t know what a spring bar
            is (I didn’t a few months ago!), they are what keep our travel
            trailer more stable while towing and enable our trailer hitch to
            safely tow a certain weight. We have the Reese weight distribution
            hitch and we thought we had put both bars in correctly, but when we
            stopped and were unhooking the trailer, we were down a spring bar.
            Calling around to every RV store in a 100-mile radius proved futile.
            Most places didn’t carry the brand Reese and the ones that did
            wouldn’t break up a set and sell just one bar. We considered buying
            a new hitch, but it was over $700 and the earliest they could get us
            in to install the hitch was over a month away. Bryan called Reese to
            explain the situation and lord, honey child, they get 10 million
            stars for customer service! They also didn’t have a way for us to
            order one bar, but they told us they would honor that we had put the
            bars in correctly this ONE time and assume that the bar had
            malfunctioned. Bryan looked up FedEx and Durango was the closest
            one.
          </p>
          <p className="my-4 font-lato text-xl tracking-wide text-justify">
            Fast forward to leaving Alpacalypse Ranch. We had been tracking the
            spring bar and the tracking system showed that it had arrived in
            Durango. I won’t bore you with the details of how many times Bryan
            called and got a different answer from FedEx on what address he
            needed to ship to, because we use a virtual mailbox and don’t have a
            physical address, but long story short, the answer he followed was
            incorrect. This lead to an incredibly tense hour of towing the
            travel trailer all over the exceptionally busy town of Durango
            trying to locate our spring bar. Bryan finally found it after they
            checked the truck about to take off and it had been marked “Return
            to sender.” After opening the box, making sure the spring bar was in
            place about ten times, letting our heart rates come down and
            laughing about how insane the past hour was, it was finally time to
            find our new home.

            Madden Peak Road Dispersed Camping
          </h2>
          <p className="my-4 font-lato text-xl tracking-wide text-justify">
            The thing about boondocking is that you are never guaranteed a spot.
            It is first come, first serve and you hopefully timed your visit
            just right. We also rely heavily on reviews from other travelers to
            make sure there is a strong cell signal and each location we stay is
            safe. Our GPS took us down the bumpy, dirt road and our hearts sank
            a little bit each time we drove by an awesome spot that was very
            much occupied. Luck was on our side when we found a secluded site
            that had ample room for us. Most dispersed camping sites have a fire
            ring to indicate it is a viable spot and this site had a large stone
            fire ring. We scouted out the best direction to park, leveled out,
            and then got to explore our new home. There were many fire bans over
            the summer making fires illegal, but luckily we had a ranger drive
            by and he told us it was ok to have a fire within the fire ring.
            Also, being in the middle of a forest, there was ample firewood for
            the taking. I grew up on an acre and a half of land and we always
            did our own yardwork. I couldn’t help but smirk as I eagerly made a
            pile of firewood, thinking about how proud my dad would be to see me
            cleaning up a national forest.

            This site was amazing. We had beautiful trees surrounding us, no
            other RVs in site, we had easy access to town, full AT&amp;T signal,
            and it was so peaceful. Until the weekend. A particularly rowdy
            bunch settled down the road and blared their music until 2 am
            Saturday night. Bryan and I enjoyed sitting by the fire, drinking
            some summer shandy, and guessing each song within the first few
            bars. At least they had good taste in music!

          <p className="my-4 font-lato text-xl tracking-wide text-justify">
            We really enjoyed slowing down our travel pace a bit, getting some
            DIY projects done around the trailer, exploring Durango, and
            planning out our travels to all of the national parks in Utah.
            Catalina found her inner Zen and her new favorite spot in the
            trailer.
