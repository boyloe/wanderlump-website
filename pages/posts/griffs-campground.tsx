          After picking up the trailer and getting an incredibly thorough walk
          through from Brady at Herold Trailer Sales, we needed a place nearby
          to unload everything from the truck into the trailer. We were also
          exhausted from the previous few days of packing and driving to Iowa,
          so we settled on a full hook up site just 30 minutes north in Altoona,
          Iowa. I don’t think we could have found a better site for our first
          stay and to get unpacked! Our spot was right on a pond, the sites were
          all concrete, perfectly level pads with lush green grass all around.
          We were lucky to even get a spot, because most of the park was full.

          For it being Bryan’s first time backing up our new trailer, he was a
          rock star. Perfect back up job on the first attempt. This was not
          luck, though. He grew up towing boats and his previous career in the
          oil industry required him to back up trailers frequently. Lumpy was
          pretty impressed. Catalina was too busy sleeping in her carrier to be
          bothered.{" "}

          What came next was entertaining for anyone peeking out their window.
          It was probably the world’s longest set up. In our defense, all of our
          stuff was brand new and either still in the box or in the storage
          bins, so it took a while to open everything up. We weren’t just
          winging it; we had prepared and downloaded the incredibly handy
          checklist, so we went step by step and after two hours, we felt fairly
          confident we wouldn’t roll away into the pond or blow up.{" "}

          Now that we were fully set up, it was time for the most crucial step –
          introducing the cats to their new home. What if they hated it? What if
          they were so stressed that they never came out of hiding? What if all
          this planning was for nothing? Our fears quickly subsided as they took
          time to sniff and explore every inch and then they both made
          themselves at home on the bed.

          There was so much work to do – unpacking, organizing, making endless
          shopping lists of additional supplies, and working our full time jobs.
          However, there was a huge weight off our shoulders. We were actually
          doing this! Now was the time to have some fun, too. We explored
          Griff’s and the many statues scattered throughout the park. We checked
          out the setup of the other rigs and took some notes. We explored
          Altoona, tried some local beer, planned our next travels, and made our
          travel trailer feel like home. Next stop – Round Lake Winery in Round
          Lake, Minnesota.
