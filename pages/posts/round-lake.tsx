          We were making our way to South Dakota, so we needed a place to stay
          between Iowa and Sioux Falls, SD. Why not stay at a winery on a lake?{" "}

          And support we did! We sampled all of the red wines - Sangiovese,
          Gander, Heron, and Drake, with the Gander being our favorite. We also
          indulged in a jumbo Bavarian pretzet with beer cheese dip, the Round
          Lake burger, and the chicken bacon ranch flatbread. After our
          delicious meal, the owner came out and chatted with us and told us we
          could wander around the vineyards with our wine. We walked along the
          lake and vineyards as the sun was setting, while sipping on wine.

          History of the Vineyards
        </h2>
        <p className="my-4 font-lato text-xl tracking-wide text-justify">
          Round Lake Vineyard and Winery is owned by Scott and Jenny
          Ellenbecker. The land has only been used as a vineyard since 2007, but
          has been in Jenny’s family for years. It used to be used as a wildlife
          bird preserve where many ornithologists came to study them. You can
          still see beautiful birds like egrets wandering the property. I don’t
          remember the specifics, but Scott told us it took three years for the
          vines to start producing viable grapes that they could harvest for
          wine.

          This place is truly magical. We highly recommend coming to try the
          food, obviously try all the wines, and explore the grounds. They even
          have a separate building to host wedding receptions. Scott had to step
          away from chatting to go drive a bride and groom around the vineyards.
