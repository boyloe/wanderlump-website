        <p className="my-4 font-lato text-xl tracking-wide text-justify">
          Great Sand Dunes National Park is just four hours south of Denver.
          FOUR! We were that close to the tallest sand dunes in North America
          for three years and never went. Having our home on wheels when we
          finally made this stop made for an unforgettable few days.

          Going Off the Grid
        </h2>
        <p className="my-4 font-lato text-xl tracking-wide text-justify">
          For those of you who don’t know what boondocking is, it is going off
          the grid. No electric, water, sewer hook ups, or amenities. This
          obviously requires a bit of planning if you want to stay somewhere for
          more than a night or two, especially when you work full-time and have
          to keep your top half presentable for the current era of Zoom calls.
          Things you take for granted like showering, brewing a pot of coffee,
          or flushing the toilet all require water and when you are off the
          grid, there is not an endless supply. However, boondocking provides
          privacy, tranquility, and usually incredible views and Bryan and I
          would much rather be in the middle of nowhere than a crowded, noisy RV
          park.

          What, Like It&apos;s Hard?
        </h2>
        <p className="my-4 font-lato text-xl tracking-wide text-justify">
          We bought a generator, water jugs, and groceries and decided to give
          boondocking a whirl. We stayed at Sacred White Shell Mountain, which
          overlooks Blanca Peak, the highest summit of the Sangre de Cristo
          Mountains. I cannot describe the emotions I felt as we parked our
          travel trailer in front of the 14,351-foot mountain peak, knowing that
          we lived there now. The wind got pretty intense at times, which led to
          some laughs while trying to add more fresh water to our tank. The wind
          did its best to make sure the water went everywhere but the funnel.

        <p className="my-4 font-lato text-xl tracking-wide text-justify">
          If you are near the Great Sand Dunes, you have to visit Zapata Falls.
          The road up to the trailhead is very rough, but it’s worth it. It is a
          short hike up from the trailhead, but you have to walk across rocks
          and the flowing water in order to get to the falls. Ask me how I know
          my Moab hiking boots are waterproof.

          Being there in early May afforded us a spectacular sight. The falls
          hadn’t completed thawed yet, so half of the falls were frozen and the
          most stunning shade of blue and half of the falls were crashing down
          from above.

          After coming down the trail we got our first peak of the sand dunes.
          We were so preoccupied to get up to the falls, we didn’t even look
          that way when we parked. Make sure you look, because it is a
          spectacular view of the dunes and Sangre de Cristo Mountains!

          Depending on when you visit the dunes, you might have to get wet
          first! Medano Creek crosses your path to the dunes during the spring
          and early summer months, created by snowmelt from the surrounding
          mountains. It was shallow while we were there, but my waterproof boots
          were put to the test again. Seeing the dunes up close while the sun
          was setting and the creek was trickling by was breathtaking. It is
          windy at the dunes, too, and each night all of the footprints and sand
          board tracks from the day are wiped away, ready for a new crowd of
          visitors in the morning.

          The next day we decided to have some fun and play on the dunes. The
          Oasis Store is right outside of the park and lets you rent equipment
          for one or multiple days. My apparatus of choice was a sled and Bryan
          opted for a sandboard. We signed a waiver, got some wax, got a quick
          demo on how to keep our board/sled extra slick, and we were off!

        </h2>
        <p className="my-4 font-lato text-xl tracking-wide text-justify">
          The weather was cloudy when we got to the dunes, which kept the sand
          nice and cool. In summer months the sand can get up to 150&#176;F. We
          made our way through the creek, sled and board over our shoulders like
          we knew what we were doing. There are many dunes to choose from, so we
          picked the closest, steepest one and hiked up. We definitely got our
          steps in that day. Climbing up soft sand dunes for hours is quite a
          work out. At the top we waxed up while watching others’ techniques,
          which included screams, laughs, huge smiles, wipe outs, and four
          letter words.

          Bryan went down first, made it about 3 seconds, and fell. We both
          laughed hysterically, assessed for injuries, and then he made it the
          rest of the way down the dune.

          My run didn’t go quite as planned. I lined myself up with the sled
          teetering over the edge, then pushed off and immediately rotated 180*,
          causing me to plummet down the dune backwards. I laugh-screamed the
          entire way and broke out into a fit of giggles at the bottom. I wish I
          could say it only happened once, but I would absolutely be lying. This
          happened EVERY. SINGLE. TIME! It was still incredibly fun and neither
          of us broke anything, so I consider that a win.
