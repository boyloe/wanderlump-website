            After our wonderful stay at Papa Moon, we decided to stay in
            Scottsbluff for the week at Riverside Park Campground. Our site was
            just down the street from the city’s namesake – Scotts Bluff
            National Monument. We hiked several trails by the monument,
            including part of the Oregon Trail. It was an easy one mile out and
            back trail and it had an audio tour giving historic details as we
            walked along the path. There are several wagons along the trail to
            demonstrate the wagons used by families. Pulling one of the wagons
            is an ox who has clearly seen some things and his eyes are forever
            unclean. There aren’t any visible wheel ruts along the trail due to
            150 years of erosion, but there is a wagon swale, which is a deep
            indentation created by the wagons traveling along Mitchell Pass.

            This was a fun and educational hike, because it also had an audio
            guided tour, and took us to the summit of Scotts Bluff. We learned
            that Scotts Bluff is named after the fur trader, Hiram Scott, who
            became too ill to travel and was left behind by fellow trappers. His
            remains were later found sixty miles away from where they abandoned
            him. We also learned that the bluff was an important landmark for
            not only the travelers along the Oregon Trail, but also the
            California, Pony Express, and Mormon Trails.

            Saddle Rock Trail starts out easy with a level path along the
            prairie and then we made our way up a steep path to a tunnel. This
            100-foot tunnel was hand carved with mainly picks and shovels,
            because the rock layers were too soft to use any machinery.

            Next comes the fun part – switchbacks for days, which took us all
            the way up to Saddle Rock. The formation is so fragile you can’t go
            near it, but it is still striking from a distance.

            On the way to the summit, the path took us right along the edge of
            the bluff, where the audio tour explains the layers of the bluff and
            how the bluff is ever changing due to erosion. We could feel the
            obvious difference in the layers, with the limestone being as hard
            as concrete and the sandstone easily coming off on Bryan’s
            fingertips.

            Yes. The weather was perfect, so we could leave the windows and
            screen door open, allowing for what we like to call “screen time.”
            They love sitting at the screen just daring a bug to come inside.
            During the day, Lumpy and Catalina sunbathed on the back of the
            chaise lounge, while Bryan and I worked long hours in order to pay
            for their extravagant lifestyle.
