            The honeymoon period is officially over

          <p className="my-4 font-lato text-xl tracking-wide text-justify">
            After all our incredible hiking at Bryce, we were excited to
            continue southwest for more amazing hiking in Zion National Park. We
            found dispersed camping about 20 minutes outside the park entrance
            and there was plenty of room for us. It was a huge open space of red
            sand and sparse vegetation, overlooking mesas. Bryan skillfully
            maneuvered around large ruts and we began the routine of getting
            level and disconnected.

            Zion is the furthest south we had been and we were much lower in
            elevation than at Bryce; 4,000 feet above sea level, compared to
            ~8,000 feet above sea level. Being 4,000 feet lower in elevation
            meant we were finally going to feel desert temperatures. That week
            the temperature was projected to be highs of 102 degrees F and only
            getting down into the mid-60s or 70s. After setting up and going
            inside, we were blasted with hot air and the thermostat made us well
            aware that it was high 90s inside. Not super ideal, but we needed to
            go to the store for groceries and supplies, so we opened all the
            windows, packed up the cats, and headed off to the store. When we
            returned after sunset, the trailer had cooled off to a chilly 91
            degrees. For those of you reading this and thinking “Just turn on
            the air conditioning,” it&apos;s not that easy with our setup. Our
            air conditioning unit is equipped to run on shore power, meaning we
            need to be plugged into an external electric source at a camp site
            or our generator. Being in the middle of nowhere, our generator was
            the only option, so Bryan went outside with his headlamp to start
            the generator and help it cool off a bit quicker. It&apos;s not the
            best etiquette to run your generator after hours (8 pm), but we knew
            it would only take a few minutes to get it to a bearable temperature
            inside. As I was inside unpacking groceries, I heard the generator
            sputter a few times and then silence. Then a few more angry sputters
            and more silence. Bryan came back inside looking disheartened and
            said something was wrong and he couldn&apos;t get it to start. Since
            it was so dark out, we settled in for a sweaty night and would
            figure out the generator in the morning.
          </p>
          <p className="my-4 font-lato text-xl tracking-wide text-justify">
            Once morning came, Bryan changed spark plugs, cleaned the
            carburetor, changed the air filter, and the generator still wouldn’t
            start. Bryan tried to trouble shoot it over the phone with our
            brother-in-law who repairs small engines for a living. Still no
            luck. The events of what came next made us question what the hell we
            were doing living in a travel trailer. Did we make a huge mistake
            thinking we could do this? We had no business trying to live this
            lifestyle.{" "}
          </p>
          <p className="my-4 font-lato text-xl tracking-wide text-justify">
            The first logical thought was to call hardware stores to see if they
            could repair the generator. The problem is that the area around Zion
            is not loaded with Home Depots, Lowe&apos;s, or any repair store,
            for that matter. Stores 30 minutes away gave us estimates of 4 weeks
            to repair it. We could not sit in the desert at 100 degrees for a
            month in an aluminum box with no air conditioning.
          </p>
          <p className="my-4 font-lato text-xl tracking-wide text-justify">
            Ok. Feeling a bit stressed out, but the second logical thought was
            to call RV parks in the area to see if they had any availability, so
            we could plug in and run that ice cold AC. Easy, peasy. Unless you
            frequent many national parks, you might not be aware of how popular
            Zion is. It was the third most visited national park until 2021,
            when it became the second most visited national park, with 5 million
            visitors flocking to a very small park, compared to other national
            parks. Zion is a whopping 229 square miles, while Yellowstone is
            3,471 square miles. Boring details, but necessary to understand why
            every RV park physically laughed us off the phone when asking if
            they had availability. One kind, sympathetic lady let us know they
            had booked out over 6 months ago and then hung up. That was two
            strikes thus far Shooter, and it was only 9 am.
          </p>
          <p className="my-4 font-lato text-xl tracking-wide text-justify">
            We were trying to manage all of this while still working, so we took
            a hot second (literally) to let the frustration and dread sink in. I
            sat there in shorts and a tank top, Bryan just in shorts, with all
            the shades drawn, knowing that the temperature was only going to
            continue to rise since there was not one inch of shade for miles.
            Lumpy and Catalina were too hot to protest, so Lumpy took refuge in
            the shower and Catalina melted in front of us on the vinyl floor. I
            could feel the heat radiating in from our giant picture window and
            felt like I had to try something. I grabbed the Reynolds wrap and
            got to work taping tinfoil over every window, the vent in the
            bathroom, and the skylight in the shower. I know I looked like a
            crazy person and now our trailer looked like we were trying to block
            the government and aliens from controlling our thoughts, but that
            made me feel better and gave us some renewed determination to find
            someone who could repair our generator in a timely manner.

            After a few more calls, we had a small engine repair shop refer us
            to an Ace Hardware in St. George, Utah. We called immediately and
            they confirmed that they could help us and have it repaired in a day
            or two. At that point, Lumpy laid herself across my laptop in full
            protest. We looked at the thermostat, which was reading 99 degrees.
            It doesn&apos;t actually go above double digits, so Bryan laid the
            meat thermometer on the countertop and it clocked in at 103 degrees.
            We scooped up the cats, grabbed stuff for work, the generator was
            already in the truck bed, and we started the 45-minute drive to St.
            George.

            On the way there, I started looking up generator rentals, hoping to
            find one to rent while ours was being repaired. The Home Depot
            closer to St. George did not have any rental generators, but the one
            an hour north of us did. Yay! Our luck was turning. We dropped off
            ours at Ace Hardware and they were hopeful they could get it looked
            at that same day and would call with an update. We started the drive
            back north (St. George was 45 minutes south of us) and realized we
            were going to miss the rental department staff by 5 minutes. We
            called hoping they could make an exception and they firmly
            reiterated that they would be locking up rental equipment at 5 pm.
            There was no point driving all the way there, so we decided to head
            into Zion. We knew it would still be way too hot to go back into the
            trailer, so we kept the truck air blasting, looked at our lonely
            trailer as we drove past it, seeing that everyone else around us had
            also succumbed to the unbearable heat and left. Most importantly,
            the cats were happy and cool once again.

            We weaved our way through the beautiful landscape along the road to
            Zion and were treated to stunning views while waiting to get into
            the park. At Zion, there is such limited space at each trailhead,
            they only allow personal vehicles on certain roads and everything
            else can only be reached by shuttles. We were allowed to drive along
            the Zion-Mount Carmel Highway, which passes through a mile long,
            narrow tunnel and to amazing geologic formations. If your vehicle or
            RV is taller than 11&apos;4” or wider than 7&apos;10”, you actually
            need a permit to drive through it and have a vehicle escort you
            through. Bryan was beyond thrilled that we were just in the truck
            and not towing our trailer, because it was a very steep and narrow
            drive. We stopped to take a closer look at Checkerboard Mesa, a
            6,670-foot-tall mesa with a checkerboard appearance, resulting from
            expanding and contracting during winter months. This drive was just
            what we needed to temporarily take our minds off the unfortunate
            events of the previous 24 hours.

            The next morning, we had big plans to get a hike in before
            hell&apos;s fury of the sun was unleashed on our trailer, go rent
            the generator, and get a full day of work in, inside our nice, cool
            trailer. We wanted to hike the Narrows, which is one of the trails
            you need to ride a shuttle to get to and the first shuttle leaves
            the visitor center at 7 am. At 6 am we pulled into a parking lot
            that looked like Disney World during Spring Break. We made our way
            up to the line and it was at least a two hour wait. Feeling like
            Zion was destined to break us, we sadly made our way back to the
            truck, stopped at the local coffee shop for some giant coffees, and
            made the trip north to Home Depot. That was the least eventful
            incident for us in several days, other than the employee not
            believing Bryan that the smaller generator would power our AC and
            him forcing us to take the goliath model. We left victorious with
            our 6,000-watt generator (ours is 3,100 watts) that was going to be
            worth every penny of the $100 per day rental fee. When we got home,
            Bryan fired it up and it was the most beautiful sound we had ever
            heard. Unfortunately, it was so hot outside, that even our
            mammoth-sized generator that could power an entire construction
            site, couldn&apos;t get the temperature in our trailer below 80
            degrees. However, we were beyond grateful for 80s and considered
            this a win.
          </p>
          <p className="my-8 font-lato text-xl tracking-wide text-justify">
            Now that we weren&apos;t melting to the vinyl couch cushions, our
            spirits were lifted and we could resume somewhat normal activity. By
            lunchtime there was no word from Ace Hardware, but towards the end
            of the day they let us know they had diagnosed the problem, but it
            would not be fixed today. No problem. The lovely Home Depot employee
            let us know we could rent Megatron another day.
          </p>
          <p className="my-8 font-lato text-xl tracking-wide text-justify">
            The next day was Friday and we didn&apos;t hear anything from Ace
            all day. We really didn&apos;t want to have to pay for the rental
            generator all weekend. Finally, around 4 pm, they called and let us
            know it was repaired and ready for pick up. We were able to get down
            there just prior to the service department closing and they
            explained that sand from windy ass Moab had blasted it&apos;s way
            into the inner workings and all it needed was a good cleaning. Ace
            Hardware, you saved us!
          </p>
          <p className="my-8 font-lato text-xl tracking-wide text-justify">
            The next morning Bryan ran up to Home Depot to return the gigantic
            generator while ours remained running like a champ. By now you
            understand why having a generator in the desert is so important, but
            we were also faced with another huge problem that was ruining our
            only reason for going to Zion. We don&apos;t feel comfortable
            leaving the generator running when we are gone, so even though it
            was functional again, we couldn&apos;t go into the park and hike,
            because it would get too hot for the cats. Were we really going to
            have spent a week at Zion without hiking any trails???
          </p>
          <p className="my-8 font-lato text-xl tracking-wide text-justify">
            Bryan got back from Home Depot and was ready to start calling RV
            parks 45 minutes to an hour away to see if they had availability.
            Then we could still go into the park, but it would be a much longer
            drive. I looked up the RV park we had driven by multiple times now,
            always with a large “No vacancy” sign displayed out front and
            figured “Why not try one more time?” You will not believe it.
            Someone had just canceled and there was a shaded spot right by the
            pool (yes, this was a fancy resort!) that our rig would JUST fit
            into and it was available for Saturday and Sunday night! We quickly
            packed up and made our way to Zion River Resort RV Park. I have
            never been so happy to be in a congested RV park with full hook ups!
            When we plugged in, the air conditioning worked its magic and we
            were below 80 degrees within an hour. I definitely teared up a bit.
            It had been a challenging week and now the cats would be safe and
            comfortable and we could finally go hiking.
          </p>
          <p className="my-8 font-lato text-xl tracking-wide text-justify">
            We found a slot canyon (narrow gorges) hike that was accessible
            without shuttles and set off. Luckily{" "}

              <a className="text-blue-400">AllTrails</a>
            </Link>{" "}
            got us there, because it was a hidden trailhead. After climbing down
            a very steep cliff and walking a few hundred feet, we entered into
            another world. We weaved our way through the narrow rocks, amazed at
            their distinct layering. Eventually the trail opened up and we
            walked along a dried-up stream. It was an enchanting hike and we
            would have wandered around for hours, but it was starting to get
            dark and we didn&apos;t need to push our luck with Zion and become a
            mountain lion snack. That night we slept soundly with the hum of the
            air conditioner lulling us to sleep.

            Since we struck out arriving at 6 am on a weekday, we knew Sunday
            was going to be even more crowded. We rolled into the parking lot by
            5 am and sleepily waited in line until 7 am. We got on the second
            shuttle and excitedly made our way back to the hike we had been
            waiting for –{" "}

            The trail isn&apos;t very long, only 4.4 miles, but it has 1,604
            elevation gain and part of the trail goes up such a narrow steep
            section that they installed poles and chains to help climb up
            without falling. Signs actually warn you of how many people have
            died hiking this trail.

            This hike was incredible! We put in some work to get up all those
            switchbacks and I tackled my fear of heights and went all the way to
            the top. The view from the tiny sliver of rock at the top was
            breathtaking. We took a snack break while taking in the view and
            there are brave chipmunks up there that have learned they will most
            likely get fed. They came right up to us trying to steal our almonds
            and granola bars.

            Remember when I told you Zion was too crowded? It appeared that
            everyone else had decided to hike this trail, too, so as we were
            descending, there were long lines of people trying to get up the
            narrowest parts. If we had been on a later shuttle, it would have
            been absolutely miserable trying to get to the top.

            By the time we got back to the bottom and hopped on the shuttle it
            was only 9 am, so we were excited to head to{" "}

            , a famous slot canyon trail. However, in true Zion fashion, someone
            had injured themself on that trail (torn ACL is what we heard), so
            that hike was closed for the rest of the day. We had come all this
            way and weren&apos;t going to be able to do the trail we were
            looking forward to the most.

            We looked at each other, shrugged, and decided that we were
            officially done with this place. We went back to the trailer and
            planned our next destination. The desert was no longer a suitable
            place for us, so we planned to make our way back north.
