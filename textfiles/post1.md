Bryan Oyloe and I are excited to share our next adventure! We are both working 100% remotely now, so we sold most of our things, put a few things in storage, and took the essentials with us into our new home on wheels. We picked up our travel trailer in Indianola, Iowa, spent a few nights in Altoona to get settled in, and then we made our way over to Custer State Park in South Dakota, where we will be staying for the next week, while we get everything registered and become SD residents. The cats are living their best life and we are too. We look forward to seeing many friends and family along our travels!
